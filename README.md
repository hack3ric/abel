# Hive üêù

*The name Hive is subject to change. Stay tuned before a new name is chosen!*

Hive is a Lua microservices framework written in Rust. It provides an easy and fun way of writing JSON RESTful APIs while maintaining great performance.

[Documentation](https://hack3ric.github.io/hive-doc)

Hive is currently under heavy development, and many functionalities are yet to be implemented. Nevertheless, feel free to try it out, and any feedback would be appreciated!

## Features

- Fully multi-threaded & asynchronous
- Writing, deploying and iterating Lua microservices without breaking a sweat
- Compliant to HTTP standards and JSON RESTful API conventions
- Sandbox environment, with limited yet powerful Sandbox API

## Getting Started

Write a hello world service and save it to `hello.lua`:
```lua
hive.register("/:name", function(req)
  return { greeting = "Hello, " .. req.params.name .. "!" }
end)
```

Run Hive:
```console
$ cargo run
```

In another shell, upload the source code and run the service:
```console
$ curl localhost:3000/services/hello -X PUT -F single=@hello.lua | jq
{
  "new_service": {
    "name": "hello"
    ...
  }
}
$ curl localhost:3000/hello/world | jq
{
  "greeting": "Hello, world!"
}
```

## Lua Version Compatibility

Hive currently uses Lua 5.4 as its runtime. Lower versions and LuaJIT support is under consideration for now.
